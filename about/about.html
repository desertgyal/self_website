              <h1>So, who am I?</h1>
              <p>
                  As an analytical thinker who likes tackling difficult problems, 
                  full-stack software development has become something that I greatly enjoy.
                  Although I first started learning programming languages in middle school, I became much more serious about coding in college after accounting 
                  class threw me for a loop and I decided that finance was not the field for me. While I learned Java, Python, and SQL in my courses, 
                  I also worked diligently to learn technologies such as Javascript and the command line on my own. 
                  This eventually led to a Fortune 500 summer internship in software development and a second fall internship which 
                  I am presently working in. 
                  In May 2021, I will complete my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Chinese. 
                  In addition to my technical skills, I also have advanced proficiency in Mandarin 
                  Chinese and intermediate proficiency in Brazilian Portuguese.
